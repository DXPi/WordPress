										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you follow tech news you might have heard of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323133002/http://netflix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netflix</a> and it’s recent success after adopting the streaming model. Their website says “For only <strong>$7.99 a month</strong>, you get unlimited movies &amp; TV episodes instantly over the Internet to your TV or computer. There are no commercials, and you can pause, rewind, fast forward or re-watch as often as you like. It’s really that easy!”</p>
<p>Isn’t this great, for just <strong>Rs.400 a month</strong>, Netflix gives Video on demand on a lot of devices (PC,macs, mobile devices, gaming consoles etc.) with recommendations, resuming playback of movies/T.V shows where you left them off and a lot more. So if you’re watching a movie late in the night and you get too sleepy, you can shut off your movie and resume it the next day on your way to work on your phone.  We end up paying more for Tata sky which doesn’t even provide video on demand or multiple device viewing.</p>
<p>This model has helped Netflix become a major success in the US and Canada with Apple choosing to bundle a Netflix app on their Apple TV as well. This gets us wondering, why isn’t there a service similar to Netflix in India?</p>
<p>Although there have been a few companies which have tried to imitate the earlier Netflix model, i.e DVD rentals none of them have become hugely popular nor have they offered attractive policies like no late fees, no due dates etc. There was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323133002/http://gigaom.com/2006/09/22/seventymm-indias-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a> on gigaOM way back in 2006 pegging seventymm as India’s Netflix, obviously the service hasn’t caught on.<br />
The posts points out a major hurdle for video rental services like these, piracy. With every railway station selling CDs of the latest movies on as soon as their release dates for as cheap as <strong>Rs.50 ($1)</strong>, it becomes a bit difficult for the survival of this model, also with increasing penetration of the not-so-fast broadband in India, you see people downloading<strong> 700mb DVD</strong>rips from piratebay even if it takes them 24 hours.</p>
<p>So Indian players haven’t even succeeded in coming on par with the Netflix of the earlier years, let alone the current streaming based Netflix. The rental service not catching up is because these players haven’t been able to come up with an effective strategy, but the non existent streaming based service is majorly because of the pathetic internet service in India.</p>
<p>The Netflix page specifies minimum connection requirements for it to work fine “Watching instantly works with all different levels of broadband, however, we recommend a minimum speed of <strong>500kpbs (0.5MB)</strong>.” In average Indian homes unfortunately this sort of connectivity is absent. Speeds like these if offered by ISPs cost a lot. So right now if an Indian Netflix would startup it would remain restricted to the offices of Indian people where stuff like this isn’t permitted. Also the mobile market isn’t ready yet for on the move media viewing, the 3G tariffs are expensive, carriers aren’t ready yet to carry huge amounts of data on their network and a huge part of Indians still don’t have smart phones.</p>
<p>This coupled with the fact that many Indians don’t want to pay for something digital. For example: They won’t hesitate much to buy pirated CDs and DVDs but they have a problem buying a <strong>$.99</strong> game from the AppStore. Fortunately this mindset is changing with the increasing penetration of Internet banking, online shopping etc. A lot of channels like NDTV, CNN, IBN, etc and events like the IPL are providing live streams online. So one can just hope for a Netflix like service to come up in India in the next five years. If they have enough partnerships for providing content then DTH services are doomed!</p>
<p>It was reported that Netflix’s competitor Google has also  launched a pay-per-view online service, in order to gain more traffic to their new service.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323133002/http://www.watblog.com/2011/04/25/why-isnt-an-online-streaming-solution-not-possible-in-india-yet/">Source</a>: I feel that we desperately need faster broadband connection for sure. It will solve a lot of problems. I feel piracy can somehow be reduced by providing faster broadband in homes and mobile phones. I would definitely want to subscribe for a 24×7 movie available for 400 Rs/per month. And save money on my broadband and electricity bill.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Below is a really nice comparison of India and China. Where we stand in terms of population, income, industry and many other.</p>
<p><strong>China started their family planning policy in 1970, India in 1952</strong></p>
<p>In 2001 our birth rate was nearly 3 times more than China. 27 births per 1000 as against 8.8 for China! India is adding 18 million people per year, against 9 million per year in China. Total addition to population is a function of total births minus total deaths.</p>
<p><strong>India’s per capita earning is US$440 per year against US$990 per year in China</strong></p>
<p>As per the World Bank, the poverty line definition is US$1 per person per day or US$365/person/year, for underdeveloped countries like India, China etc. As per the official data from both governments, China has 3% population below the poverty line, compared to India’s 26 to 29%! Only better governance can help.</p>
<p><strong>China attracts 87 million tourists per year (this is expected to reach 90 million in 2002) against 2.5 million per year to India.</strong></p>
<p>The international Tourism Industry is [7 times the size of I.T. or software] about, US$3700 billion per year. India, in spite of its old history and 21 cultures and languages, seems to have ‘missed the bus’, in Tourism. Tourism is a very big employment generator. It is estimated that every one tourist generates 2 to 4 jobs. Tourism promotes International trade and understanding.<br />
<strong>How will we provide additional 10 million jobs per year?</strong></p>
<p>The Public Sector and State/Central Government, which is already overstaffed, has a total of 18.7 million employees, therefore offers very little scope for new employment. We have to look outside the government for new employment. The unorganized sector and the SME’s (SSI is not SME) offer the maximum scope for employment, like in all other countries of the world, including China. SME’s account for nearly 75% of employment and 80% of trainees!</p>
<p><strong>The Government can only facilitate jobs; they cannot provide jobs for the 300 million partly or fully unemployed in India!</strong></p>
<p>At 10 million jobs per year it will take us 30 years to remove unemployment, at 5 million jobs for year it will take us 60 years! The present Indian ‘mind set’ will require rethinking and reorganization of the existing perceptions about Public Sector enterprises, and the actual role they are supposed to play! Only efficient organizations can deliver results and growth. Only better governance and efficient administration can deliver results!</p>
<p><strong>In Foreign Direct investment, FDI, China + Hong Kong received US$106 billion last year [US$70billion from NRC&#8217;s] vs US$3.6 billion [US$0.2b from NRI&#8217;s] for India! Only better Governance can attract FDI and Tourists. In exports, China is nearly +700% of India</strong></p>
<p>Taking the exports of Hong Kong + Macau into account, China’s exports would be +1000% of India! China’s GDP is 50% in manufacturing or $ 650 billion per year. India’s GDP is 25% in manufacturing or $110 billion per year. China’s manufacturing base is nearly 6 times of India’s.</p>
<p><span id="more-2946"></span><br />
<strong>In agriculture our yields per acre, are well below the international norms.</strong></p>
<p>India could be a giant exporter of food, only if we could put our ‘house in order’ to near world class standards! China with lesser cultivable land, produces double the food grains, at 415 million tons per year compared with India’s 208 million tons per year. God has been very kind to India with a lot of sunshine, rain, rivers, lakes, coastline and good hard working citizens.<br />
The governance of hamlets, villages, cities, districts, Government and Semi-Government agencies, as facilitators, have not done enough to show the results that India is able or capable of achieving. India would definitely rate as the No.1 country in the world, for Potential vs Performance!<br />
Indians score high marks on performance, outside India! This is because the Governance is better outside. In countries where the Governance &amp; Administration is poor, the performance of its citizens is also low!</p>
<p><strong>In Education, 99.1% of Chinese children attend school for 9 years, this ensures a high level of literacy. In India, literacy is 50 to 60%</strong></p>
<p>While IIT’s, IIM’s are important, the country’s real growth will come because of primary and secondary education and vocational and educational training in all districts of the country. India can rise and shine in exports, agriculture, literacy and other areas with better governance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let’s see the scene of tobacco and smoking in India first. OK, some facts and figures about Smoking and Tobacco in India.</p>
<ul>
<li>In India, tobacco use causes nearly 40 percent of all health problems and 50 percent of all cancers, according to Health Minister, Anbumani Ramadoss.</li>
<li>In India The tobacco contributes to 56.4% and 44.9% of cancers in men and women, respectively.</li>
<li><strong>India ranks 2nd in smoking cigarette in top 10 countries.</strong></li>
<li>Nearly 17 percent of students in India, aged 15 and under, use some form of tobacco, mainly cigarettes, according to a survey conducted by the World Health Organization.</li>
<li>India has the largest number of oral cancer cases in the world which is due to tobacco.</li>
<li>In India, an estimated 120 million people smoke. But the problem is that smoking in India is on rising side unlike Western countries.</li>
<li>Cigarettes compromise just 19 percent of tobacco consumption in India however Bidis account for 53 percent, according to the Bidi Smoking and Public Health report by the Union Ministry of Health and Family.</li>
<li><strong>Around 1 billion Bidis are sold in India every year.</strong> Bidis contain more tar, nicotine and other toxic substances but less tobacco than traditional cigarettes.</li>
<li>Tobacco smoking accounts for 82% of Chronic obstructive lung disease in India.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s been around 1 year now that Indian Government imposed ban on smoking in public places including government and private offices. You might not know but this act was in existence for 2 years before our government thought of implementing it seriously. Seriously, imagine. We create acts, put them in files, make a pile out of it, put them in a room somewhere and then don’t look at them for 3-4 years. Then suddenly you wake up and try to enforce everything. And I’ll tell you some facts about this so called smoking ban in public places today. Well, I think I don’t really have to tell you anything as most of you already know it to some extent.</p>
<p>Alright let’s first discuss what the ban exactly is. As per the government, no one is allowed to smoke in public places including public transportation and public offices etc. As per the rules, smoking is banned in shopping malls, cinema halls, public/private work place, hotels, banquet halls, discotheques, canteen, coffee house, pubs, bars, airport lounge, railway stations. Public places cover all government, private and public sector offices as well. I work with an MNC and believe me there people adhere to the regulation. People go out of the offices for smoke. Earlier employees could smoke in the office premises but ever since the smoking ban everyone is prohibited to smoke inside the office premises. Also, any employer found to be letting its employees smoke inside the office premises are supposed to be penalized. Moreover I think people working with big MNCs in India are mature enough to understand what it means for our country. We tell clients coming from abroad that there are restrictions on smoking inside the premises, so we don’t want them to see us smoking in there.</p>
<p><span id="more-2359"></span>Alright, that’s the rule now lets see how is our government who imposed the ban is doing about it. You remember me <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130308104834/http://www.revolutioners.com/visit-to-mtnl-sanchaar-haat-a-must-read/">visiting MTNL office</a>, I saw employees smoking inside the building. Well, that was not it. I shave seen many more government offices with people smoking inside the offices. But today was the height of everything, I went to a government office today (would not want to quote) and saw employee smoking in the building that too on his seat as well. And the head of the office was also smoking in the office.</p>
<p>I just want to understand why has it always been like this? <strong>Why do we citizens only have to follow all the rules?</strong> Why the people who create the rules, don’t have to adhere to them.</p>
<p>And believe me its not the only thing which is wrong these days Things like these keep happening in our country. It has been in existence in one or another form with each and every government department of India. <strong>For example, Delhi Police does not need any helmet while driving on the road but they want each and every rider in Delhi to wear helmet and don’t miss a chance of not giving ticket to the rider if he/she is not wearing the helmet.</strong>Similarly they want everyone to wear seat-belts while driving even if the traffic is not even moving. <em>Every government department you go in, you’d find yourself on the verge of having an argument all the time</em>. People don’t really seem to take their jobs seriously.</p>
<p>I am not able to understand the mentality of our government employees as in why do these people behave like this. I mean its good that you are sitting there in a government office but aren’t you suppose to work. Yeah, let me not just start that. I’d need an entire book on that just one post won’t be enough I guess.</p>
<p>Don’t know when would we be free, free as in FREE…! The ultimate question is should we try and ban these things from selling or should we ban smoking of cigarettes. ?</p>
<p>Some interesting reading about tobacco and smoking.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoiding tobacco adds 20 years to the life of a teenager.</li>
<li><strong>In India, 900,000 people die due to tobacco related diseases per year.</strong></li>
<li>Tobacco smoking accounts for 82% of Chronic obstructive lung disease in India.</li>
<li><strong>Tobacco indirectly causes lung tuberculosis.</strong> Prevalence of TB is about 3 times as great among the ever-smokers as among the never-smokers. The heavier the smoking, either cigarettes or bidis, the greater the prevalence of TB among smokers. Mortality from TB is 3 to 4 times as great in ever-smokers as in never-smokers.</li>
<li><strong>About half of the teenagers who use tobacco will eventually be killed by it (about a quarter in middle age and a quarter in old age).</strong></li>
<li>It is estimated that India as compared to any other country will have the fastest rise in tobacco related deaths each year.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alright, I think its the time that I talk about the burning issue of Commonwealth Games supposed to be held in Delhi, India. I think we are trying our best to keep them here but somehow I am getting this feeling that we are not ready. Our government has not even started the construction of some of the stadiums. We I really wish our Indian Government best of luck. May God bless them with some wisdom. Why do these guys not understand that it will be less shameful if we tell the Commonwealth Games community that we are not ready to host the event rather then the athletes coming to India and coming to know that we are not even able to provide the basic facilities to them. Forget about organizing the Commonwealth Games 2010.</p>
<p>Anyways, If I assume it happens and we have all the stadiums ready to organize the games. Though our government has to do a really good job here to crack this nut. What if the people of India are not ready. We are overlooking this part. We have not even considered this factor yet. There will be a huge number of foreigners coming to Delhi and Indian tourism will get a drastic boost during September till December 2010.</p>
<p>I feel there are certain things that we need to take are as Indian citizens. People who are coming from other countries will not be familiar with our countries, so we will have to make sure we help them as much as we can. China was ready for Olympics a year ago from the actual event and we are running late.</p>
<p>Today I am just asking to you remember these 10 things which if done properly would definitely make our country better in terms of hospitality and people coming from other countries will also look at as developing country not under developed.</p>
<p><strong>Give Shelter</strong> : As per Indian Government, Delhi is going to be short of accommodation for at least 6,000 tourists coming to Delhi. I urge every Delhite to make sure if you know someone who is coming to see Commonwealth Games then ask them to stay with you at your house if possible. Otherwise it will really be shameful to not to have space to stay for them.</p>
<p><strong>Have some Generosity</strong> : You might have seen it already when people come from the western side of the world in India they are being overcharged by Indian people. To a certain limit its acceptable. But when people coming at this large scale I don’t think it will be required to do that. So I would urge you all Indians to not to promote such things. If you see some auto rickshaw or taxi driver or any shopkeeper overcharging the foreigners, please go help them.</p>
<p><strong>Keep your city Clean</strong> : Don’t just pee and spit anywhere, I know many of you are reading this would not come under that category, but just think about it. Our government has spent millions in creating places for emergencies like these. I wish we had a rule for penalizing anyone who is found to be spitting on road. And anyone not following it would be charged 500 Rs on the spot. And mainly those Gukta guys, I just can’t explain it. So, guys please mind your tongue for 2 months at least.</p>
<p><strong>Learn to behave</strong> : We by nature are very generous and hospitable, but only for Indians and our brothers. We need to show this hospitality to everyone who is coming to our country. This is the only way we can show our hospitality to the world and people who would come and visit our mother land. Remember<strong> ” Athiti Devo Bhava”</strong> There might be people who are coming to India for the first time and would expect everything to go right.</p>
<p><strong>Help National Security</strong> : We saw terrorist attacks in Mumbai and Delhi this year and last year as well. Mumbai Blasts, Delhi Blasts etc. I am not sure what our government has learnt from it. But I want you to help avoid these kind of mishaps. Help our Security professionals to keep our country safe. I would request you all to report anything you suspect.</p>
<p><strong>Follow traffic rules</strong> : <em>Better late then never</em>, what is this. I don’t understand. Who is <em>late</em>, what is never. I don’t know. All I know is I am getting late and if the traffic signal is not working then I am not going to wait. Please, don’t don’t do this. Don’t show that we don’t have traffic manners. Indians need to understand that traffic rules are not meant to be broken only, then are suppose to be followed as well. Its OK if you wait for 2 minutes and let other pass. If you notice, in hurry you spend 15 minutes standing on the signal because you stuck everybody on the signal. Don’t <a href="http://www.revolutioners.com/tips-for-rash-driving-on-indian-roads/">drive rash</a> on roads during the games.</p>
<p><strong>Respect their cultures</strong> : We might see people coming from various countries and cultures. We need to learn to respect their cultures. Their way of living will be different. In western culture display of public affection is not bad but in our culture its not suppose to be a good thing. We need to come out of this conservative ideology and start behaving like a developed country. If we need to be a Developed Country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is this all about ? What the crap ? What the hell is wrong with Kuldeep ? Why is he writing on such a pathetic topic? While your mind is flooded with all these kinds of questions, there goes one more. Ever wondered how any people die just because of rash driving. I know what you are thinking now. Alright let me tell you.l I did some digging on this. We are number 1 yey ! According to World Road Statistic data 2007 around 1 million people died in road accident. Now what do you think how many of those 1 million people would have died because of their own mistakes. I would say not more than 50%. So how did the rest of the half a million people die in road accidents. The answer is they all died because some jackass was driving rash.</p>
<p>I also drive rash, But I drive with safety and that too when its required and most of all with intelligence. Yeah, I know what you are thinking. But believe me I don’t act like a school kid who has been just handed over the keys of the car or bike. I have been driving car and riding bikes for the last 8-9 years now. And you know what I am from the most crowded part of India. I am from Delhi. I think anyone who has driven safely on Delhi roads can drive anywhere in the world.  Let me get to the point now because I guess I would have to dedicate a whole new blog to just write about Indian Traffic Rules and Regulations. Its really pathetic how Indian people don’t even think about the traffic rules. And the funny part is the same people who jump traffic signals and break traffic rules, if they go in a different country follow every damn traffic rules. Ever thought why is that the case? Well let me tell you. Its because of our government servants.When we go in a different country we know if we break any traffic rules, the penalty will be so Hugh that they would have to rip their asses off to pay the ticket money. On the other hand in India its mere 100 bucks and that too if you don’t have any policemen in distant relation. But don’t worry if you don’t have any policemen in relation you can just bribe these guys. Just slip a 50 Rs note and you are free.</p>
<p>Alright lets get to the point now. Here are some tips to drive rash on Indian Roads. Believe me they are tried and tested and learnt after 8-9 years of experience.</p>
<h3><strong>Always Drive on left side of the road</strong></h3>
<p>Whenever I have to drive fast, I always drive on the left side of the road. Specially at a crossing. I have met with 2-3 accidents on my bike while I was on the right hand side of the road. The problem is when you are driving on the right hand side you can’t see what is coming from the front because your view is blocked by the railing. <em>And we being Indians we don’t stop/slow down on intersections</em>. Trust me most of the accidents on the road happen because of this reason only. You can’t see what is coming from the right hand side but by the time you realize it, its too late.  But at the same time if you are driving on the left side of the road you have a really good time and view to see if someone is coming from front or right hand side of the road. I have tested it and it really works. I have escaped/saved a lot of accidents this way. So the solution is start driving on the left side while crossing an intersection. I think those railings should be removed from the divider at an intersection for at least around 100 meters so that someone coming on the road can look at both sides of the road if someone is coming or not.</p>
<h3><span class="removed_link" title="http://www.revolutioners.com/commonwealth-games-2010-things-you-can-do-to-contribute-for-a-successful-event/"><strong>Always follow Traffic rules</strong></span></h3>
<p>Indians have just re-engineered the whole traffic signal system. <strong>For us Red means if there is place don’t stop and go on. Yellow is, speed up its going to turn red. Green is, it will turn red hurry up, honk honk and honk.</strong> Damn this is funny. OK. Now this is one of the smartest tips if you ask me. Now you would be thinking how can it be a tip for driving rash. Well the thing is you can drive rash without breaking the rules as well. I mean drive fast, but don’t jump red lights, don’t change lane too often, don’t jump in front of someone like an idiot, don’t keep honking. You know I only drive fast and so called rash when its really required. There is no such pleasure then driving/riding slow. So drive fast/rash until and unless there is a need to it.</p>
<h3><strong>Always look through</strong></h3>
<p>How many times it happened that you were driving really nice and suddenly the person in front of you just stood on the break and your car went creening on the road and you managed to stop the car just an inch away from the car in front of you. It has happened right. So the thing is, if you are driving make sure you are not just watching the car in front of you. Look through the car in front of you. If you see that driver driving madly and stopping suddenly because of xyz reason you have a good amount of time.</p>
<p>I usually not look at the car just in front of me. I watch right into the rear and front mirror and look at the car next to the car in front of me. This way, I keep an eye on the car in front and concentrate on the car that is running in front of the car I am driving behind.</p>
<h3><strong>Don’t play it loud</strong></h3>
<p>Well I am sure people who drive rash they have a nice music system in their cars. When you drive rash and the music is loud you can’t hear anyone honking from the back and then you suddenly try to change the lane. This gets dangerous when that vehicle is two wheeler. So stay put, don’t drive out loud.</p>
<h3><strong>Don’t drink and drive</strong></h3>
<p>Here is the thing. You are drunk and you’ve got friends who are also drunk. Get a drunkard’s cab. Yeah they are in business now. Now what, you show off. You show them how well you can drive. In that madness you drive here and there and that’s it. That is the beginning of the end of your life. Don’t drink and drive. I am speaking from my personal experience.</p>
<p><strong>Share it if you would like to save someone’s life.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I saw it coming. I knew <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130308094546/http://www.revolutioners.com/google-earth-helped-terrorists-but-isro-bhuvan-will-not-what-a-joke/">ISRO Chandrayaan</a> was going to be a failure. I had doubts and ISRO has not left me with any doubts now. Our government has already wasted m0ney on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130308094546/http://www.revolutioners.com/google-earth-helped-terrorists-but-isro-bhuvan-will-not-what-a-joke/">ISRO Bhuvan </a>and now this.</p>
<blockquote><p>ISRO chairman Madhavan Nair has confirmed: “We will have to face the reality but we will have a better opportunity tomorrow.”<br />
<span id="more-1364"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>These guys aren’t over yet. They still wants to waste our money. I am not in favor of these kinds of missions. As stated earlier I want our government to invest in Indian Infrastructure. Build new Railway tracks, build new airports, build better roads; I mean there are millions of things that our government could do. Our government just simply wasted 81 million $ which could have been utilized in a better manner.  It does not matter whether we spent lesser money compared to what others have. All that matters is that we did waste money. And what is bothering me now is that our government is not ready to learn any lesson from this.</p>
<p>“The mission is definitely over. We have lost contact with the spacecraft,” Mayilsamy Annadurai, Project Director of the Chandrayaan-1, told PTI. He said the mission had almost completed its scientific objectives. <strong>“It has done its job technically … 100 per cent. Scientifically also, it has done almost 90-95 per cent of its job,”</strong> said Mr. Annadurai.</p>
<p>What job are we talking about here. What did ISRO Chandrayaan achieve. I am not sure. Can someone throw some light on the achievements of our ISRO Chandrayaan mission apart from some pictures being taken from it.</p>
<p>The mission was built to be failed. Its been proven now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever noticed it. You take out your vehicle and start your journey to your usualy daily destination. But suddenly you see a dead street dog on the road. The dog was over ran by some vehicle. I don’t know about you guys, but I get very disappointed and feel bad about it.</p>
<p>I decided to write about it today because I saw one dead dog on the road while coming back from office.</p>
<p>I have seen this a lot of times. Some times really nice dogs are found dead. I am a dog lover. I adore them a lot. It does not matter whether its a street dog or a pet dog.</p>
<p>On this, I am asking your suggestion. How can we reduce these kind of incidents. As of now our government has failed to do anything on this. It takes atleast 2-3 days to clean up that dead body from the road. This is how our Muncipality department works.</p>
<p>Now let me talk more about our non profit organizations. I am not in touch with any of them so I don’t know how well they operate. But I feel except 10% or the non-profit organizations in India all are fraud. They are just there to earn money. Its a business for them. Social service is not the cause for them.</p>
<p>What do you guys suggest , how can we stop or reduce these kind incidents. I have just given you an idea about dog but there are many other animals that I see dead and ran over by some vehicle.</p>
