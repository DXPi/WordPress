										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many things that Indian Government needs to fix but these are some of them which I feel will make or break our country’s future in the coming years.</p>
<p><strong>Inflation</strong>: With the most of India’s vast population living close to or below the poverty line, inflation acts as a ‘Poor Man’s Tax’. This effect is amplified when food prices rise, since food represents more than half of the expenditure of this group.</p>
<p><strong>Terrorism</strong> &#8211; I know it should have been on the top of the list however I chose it to be on the 2nd place because people are any which ways dying due to not being able to feed themselves because of the rise in price of the consumable commodities.We spend a huge amount of money on defense but where is the defense. We have been preparing for WW III for I don’t know how long. And in that process we have forgotten to spend money in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>Unemployment</strong> – Not a big deal in the rural areas but a huge concern for the people living in the urban areas. It seems to have deteriorated in the past 1 year but we need to go miles from here. We are no where near what a developed country should be. Unemployment rate as of now is around 10%</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong> – We need around 100 CWG games organized in our country for the infrastructure to improve. After writing the last sentence, I pondered over it for a couple of seconds and this funny thought occurred to me that we would have 100 more corrupt events and millions of rupees will go into our politicians’ pockets again.</p>
<p><strong>Indo-Pak Relation</strong>: To be absolutely frank, we have to take a stand if we really want to solve this problem. It may not be a problem for the neighboring country but it is affecting us as a country, a lot. We have enough army to defeat a country like Pakistan. At the least give the opponent something to think about before they try or think about doing something which brings disgrace to our country. We keep sitting idle and wait for their response all the time after someone takes responsibility to attack India.</p>
<p><strong>Indian Constitution</strong>: I feel the root of all the problems is our constitution. Written over 60 years ago. Things are bound to change. We are still living in the same 60 year old world. We were a developing country then and are still a developing country. There hasn&#8217;t been any change, moreover our politicians and constitution has brought nothing but misery to our country.</p>
<p><strong>Uneducated Politicians</strong>: We are living in a country where an uneducated/illiterate (politically) person can enter the world of politics. We are living in a state of spiritual disbelief of which our politicians are taking undue advantage. We need to get out of this situation, and pretty fast. But the concern is who will bell the cat. These people are strong and powerful because of their unlawful deeds and its hard to reverse the effects for good.</p>
<p><strong>Division of States</strong>: If we can divide the states then it’s imminent that we would have around 30 countries within India in the next 10 years. Dividing states further was the first weakness shown by a weak leader of our country. People will demand unethical things, it does not mean you mess up with the idea of peace and forget what you are supposed to do.</p>
<p><strong>Communal Riots</strong>: We are the world’s second largest standing army in the world. It definitely means something. But a bunch of people take over a state. Terrorize it. I am not convinced with the fact that a million armed forces can’t take down these Naxalites or any other Maoist groups. We declared them as terrorist groups but we can’t fight them. Over 30% of Indian states are affected by these groups in one way or the other.</p>
<p><strong>Education</strong>: 40% of world’s illiterate population is from India. Nothing much to say about this one.</p>
<p>These are my thoughts. There are so many good things to point out. And the web is flooded with information like that but till the time we don’t highlight the bad it won’t turn into good. That’s my theory. We can’t make something right till the time we don’t believe that there is something wrong.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Around Diwali, the usual constant stream of “visitors” will show up. The crew of building watchmen (half a dozen of whom you’ve never seen before), the janitor, the postman, the maid, and probably some random strangers chancing their luck – they will all knock on your door looking for Diwali “Baksheesh.” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baksheesh">Baksheesh</a> is a term that loosely refers to either a tip or, interestingly, a bribe.</p>
<p>For people, the popularity of tipping has always been something of a mystery. Take restaurant tipping as a typical example. Since the tip is usually given at the end of the meal, what good purpose does it serve? Since the service has already been provided, it can’t by definition affect the quality of the service you received? It would make sense maybe for a repeat customer on the basis that a kind tip would lead to the probability of better service next time.</p>
<p>But <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/be390fbe-a893-11d9-87a9-00000e2511c8.html#axzz1bhFznael">researchers</a> have something else to say. As per the researchers, tipping is equally likely to yield same service whether a customer plans to return or not. The consensus seems to be that tipping is best understood as a social norm, a form of charitable giving tied to the provision of a service.</p>
<p><span id="more-3341"></span>But back to the folks knocking on your door.  Should you be giving them? Why do they expect a tip at Diwali, when you tend to tip them anyway throughout the year, such as when the watchman helps bring up a heavy parcel, or maid comes thrice a day on your request?</p>
<p>During Diwali, Its believed and wise to make necessary pay-outs to avoid sudden disruption of services. So try the formula desribed below and let me know what difference did it make:</p>
<ol>
<li> Begin with a firm budget. Make sure you have in mind about how much to spend on Baksheesh during the festive season well in advance.</li>
<li>Prepare a list of service-providers in descending order of importance. Like Milkman, Sweeper, Maid, Newspaper Wallah, Watchman etc.</li>
<li>Divide the service providers into 2 different lists. First, those who need to be motivated and second, those who need recognition.</li>
<li>Now divide each list further into 3 parts, depending the importance of work they do for you and your family. The persons in the <strong>first list</strong> are the most important service providers like the maid, watchman and liftman. If anyone of them is disappointed, it results in immediate fall-out action. The maid will come late, much after your wife or mom has completed half the housework. The watchman will permit hawkers to knock at our door in the afternoons and spoil your siesta. And the liftman will declare that the lift is under repair and ensure that you climb six floors. They, therefore, should be given top most priority.</li>
<li>In the <strong>second list</strong> houses service providers that are not so important but are required alm0st everyday like, the milkman, the washerwoman and the sweeper. Since the milkman and washerwoman are paid on a daily basis, they recognise that we may have some cash-flow problems. They seem satisfied with smaller amounts. The sweeper, however, needs to be handled with care. He has the power to skip a few days’ garbage collection and cause serious nasal disorder.</li>
<li>The<strong> third list</strong> consists of the people that are not so important like, telephone, post and telegraph community. This list does not evoke too much concern. The importance of the telephone lineman has taken a huge dip. A faulty line does not bother people any more in these days of the mobile phone except you are the broadband subscriber. The post and telegraph group too does not attract too much money. The e-mail has made letter-writing redundant. Therefore you may want to keep service providers alike in this list.</li>
</ol>
<p>A little off topic, there’s a certain irony in being expected to offer a Diwali Baksheesh to someone like the postman who is a government employee and is supposed to do his job without expecting or receiving a tip. Perhaps the double meaning of Baksheesh is fitting here since people have become used to paying bribes for services that they’re entitled to.</p>
<p>I have always remained a keen observer of these Diwali pay-outs over the last so many years and am fascinated by the methods employed by the beneficiaries to gain more handsome pay-outs. Each one carries a list of neighbourhood donors. We know our neighbours well enough to realise that the figures are grossly exaggerated. This is an old technique called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure">Peer Pressure</a>.</p>
<p>I am also intrigued by the fact that the beneficiaries never come in a bunch. They stagger their time of arrival through careful networking, without doubt. All said, the Diwali baksheesh — both the handing and receiving of it — is an interesting exercise in human management.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. Happy Diwali to you and your familiy in advance.</p>
<p>If you like the post then take 2 minutes and share it with your friends and family. Also do let me know via comments if it helped you or not?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you follow tech news you might have heard of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323133002/http://netflix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netflix</a> and it’s recent success after adopting the streaming model. Their website says “For only <strong>$7.99 a month</strong>, you get unlimited movies &amp; TV episodes instantly over the Internet to your TV or computer. There are no commercials, and you can pause, rewind, fast forward or re-watch as often as you like. It’s really that easy!”</p>
<p>Isn’t this great, for just <strong>Rs.400 a month</strong>, Netflix gives Video on demand on a lot of devices (PC,macs, mobile devices, gaming consoles etc.) with recommendations, resuming playback of movies/T.V shows where you left them off and a lot more. So if you’re watching a movie late in the night and you get too sleepy, you can shut off your movie and resume it the next day on your way to work on your phone.  We end up paying more for Tata sky which doesn’t even provide video on demand or multiple device viewing.</p>
<p>This model has helped Netflix become a major success in the US and Canada with Apple choosing to bundle a Netflix app on their Apple TV as well. This gets us wondering, why isn’t there a service similar to Netflix in India?</p>
<p>Although there have been a few companies which have tried to imitate the earlier Netflix model, i.e DVD rentals none of them have become hugely popular nor have they offered attractive policies like no late fees, no due dates etc. There was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323133002/http://gigaom.com/2006/09/22/seventymm-indias-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a> on gigaOM way back in 2006 pegging seventymm as India’s Netflix, obviously the service hasn’t caught on.<br />
The posts points out a major hurdle for video rental services like these, piracy. With every railway station selling CDs of the latest movies on as soon as their release dates for as cheap as <strong>Rs.50 ($1)</strong>, it becomes a bit difficult for the survival of this model, also with increasing penetration of the not-so-fast broadband in India, you see people downloading<strong> 700mb DVD</strong>rips from piratebay even if it takes them 24 hours.</p>
<p>So Indian players haven’t even succeeded in coming on par with the Netflix of the earlier years, let alone the current streaming based Netflix. The rental service not catching up is because these players haven’t been able to come up with an effective strategy, but the non existent streaming based service is majorly because of the pathetic internet service in India.</p>
<p>The Netflix page specifies minimum connection requirements for it to work fine “Watching instantly works with all different levels of broadband, however, we recommend a minimum speed of <strong>500kpbs (0.5MB)</strong>.” In average Indian homes unfortunately this sort of connectivity is absent. Speeds like these if offered by ISPs cost a lot. So right now if an Indian Netflix would startup it would remain restricted to the offices of Indian people where stuff like this isn’t permitted. Also the mobile market isn’t ready yet for on the move media viewing, the 3G tariffs are expensive, carriers aren’t ready yet to carry huge amounts of data on their network and a huge part of Indians still don’t have smart phones.</p>
<p>This coupled with the fact that many Indians don’t want to pay for something digital. For example: They won’t hesitate much to buy pirated CDs and DVDs but they have a problem buying a <strong>$.99</strong> game from the AppStore. Fortunately this mindset is changing with the increasing penetration of Internet banking, online shopping etc. A lot of channels like NDTV, CNN, IBN, etc and events like the IPL are providing live streams online. So one can just hope for a Netflix like service to come up in India in the next five years. If they have enough partnerships for providing content then DTH services are doomed!</p>
<p>It was reported that Netflix’s competitor Google has also  launched a pay-per-view online service, in order to gain more traffic to their new service.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323133002/http://www.watblog.com/2011/04/25/why-isnt-an-online-streaming-solution-not-possible-in-india-yet/">Source</a>: I feel that we desperately need faster broadband connection for sure. It will solve a lot of problems. I feel piracy can somehow be reduced by providing faster broadband in homes and mobile phones. I would definitely want to subscribe for a 24×7 movie available for 400 Rs/per month. And save money on my broadband and electricity bill.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do you think. I know I am talking the hard way here. But the situation is like that it will not get resolved with Mahatma Gandhi. We need people like Bhagat Singh and Rajguru to take initiatives and save us from our old conservative politicians.</p>
<p>The situation is getting worse day by day. The crime is taking its toll. No political party seems to care about the citizens of India. Everybody is playing the blame game.</p>
<p>I believe India would have gone miles ahead if we had saved the leaders like Rajiv Gandhi. We need young blood to lead India, not 70 year old man who can barely walk on his feet. We need to come out of our 500 years old mentality that only old men are experienced. We are living in 21st century where what we are learning today, none of our politicians would have even dreamt of doing. Forget about learning, 80% of our politicians would not be graduate even.</p>
<p>We need educated young people who understands the dynamics of today. We don’t need people who are 70 years old and does not even know where to invest and services to provide to their citizens.</p>
<p>I don’t want to elaborate on this. I think you have understood what I am trying to say.</p>

<blockquote><p>Do you think Jawahar Lal Nehru did the right thing by agreeing to Muhammad Ali Jinnah ?</p></blockquote>
<p>Before you come to any conclusions, I just want to let you know that I am just asking for your opinion. I have put across my thoughts, now I need to know what you think. Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru when agreed to Muhammad Ali Jinnah would have thought that now India would live happily ever after. But I guess they were wrong, I mean they have been wrong all throughout. Pakistan has gone so far sometimes after the division that its unbearable, but still we Indians believe in Peace. We still believe in talks with our neighbor countries. We still believe that <strong>“Kutte ki poonch Seedhi ho jayegi”.</strong> We still think that now we will live without any fear since our Prime Minister is a bit aggressive now. What the hell ?</p>
<p>My only point is that its our politicians who have been giving us pain all through out . Had Jawahar Lal Nehru not agreed to Muhammad, we would have had a single country spanning a long Kashmir having the most amazing tourist place ever. Imagine Afridi and Sehwag opening for India. No power would have stopped that India to win against any country. What a scene would that be. Imagine the biggest tourist place in the world for its beautiful mountains, a place known to be heaven on earth. We could have been so advanced today that the whole world would have envied us.</p>
<p>But let’s face the reality. Since both the countries are not in good terms and are always fighting, we spend over billions on getting the most latest and deadliest weapons from Israel and Russia. Just imagine 3-4% of GDP of India and Pakistan going into preparing for battle against each other. Imagine this money spent for good cause, for betterment of both countries. None of the countries people have proper food to eat, but we want to fight. The whole world looks at us as a country of poor, which some time ago used to be the “<strong>Golden Bird</strong>.” Had we spent those billions for improving our infrastructure then what a country India would have been. People would have lead a life which they deserve rather than leading their lives in fear of getting blasted in some suicide bombing.</p>
<p>I really feel that our life was fcuked on that day when India and Pakistan parted their ways. Just wait for some time, its quite possible that India will get partitioned further because we have the same Congress in center which made all this possible. Rumors are that China is thinking of creating a mess in India and trying to divide India into several parts.</p>
<p>What do you say ?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Below is a really nice comparison of India and China. Where we stand in terms of population, income, industry and many other.</p>
<p><strong>China started their family planning policy in 1970, India in 1952</strong></p>
<p>In 2001 our birth rate was nearly 3 times more than China. 27 births per 1000 as against 8.8 for China! India is adding 18 million people per year, against 9 million per year in China. Total addition to population is a function of total births minus total deaths.</p>
<p><strong>India’s per capita earning is US$440 per year against US$990 per year in China</strong></p>
<p>As per the World Bank, the poverty line definition is US$1 per person per day or US$365/person/year, for underdeveloped countries like India, China etc. As per the official data from both governments, China has 3% population below the poverty line, compared to India’s 26 to 29%! Only better governance can help.</p>
<p><strong>China attracts 87 million tourists per year (this is expected to reach 90 million in 2002) against 2.5 million per year to India.</strong></p>
<p>The international Tourism Industry is [7 times the size of I.T. or software] about, US$3700 billion per year. India, in spite of its old history and 21 cultures and languages, seems to have ‘missed the bus’, in Tourism. Tourism is a very big employment generator. It is estimated that every one tourist generates 2 to 4 jobs. Tourism promotes International trade and understanding.<br />
<strong>How will we provide additional 10 million jobs per year?</strong></p>
<p>The Public Sector and State/Central Government, which is already overstaffed, has a total of 18.7 million employees, therefore offers very little scope for new employment. We have to look outside the government for new employment. The unorganized sector and the SME’s (SSI is not SME) offer the maximum scope for employment, like in all other countries of the world, including China. SME’s account for nearly 75% of employment and 80% of trainees!</p>
<p><strong>The Government can only facilitate jobs; they cannot provide jobs for the 300 million partly or fully unemployed in India!</strong></p>
<p>At 10 million jobs per year it will take us 30 years to remove unemployment, at 5 million jobs for year it will take us 60 years! The present Indian ‘mind set’ will require rethinking and reorganization of the existing perceptions about Public Sector enterprises, and the actual role they are supposed to play! Only efficient organizations can deliver results and growth. Only better governance and efficient administration can deliver results!</p>
<p><strong>In Foreign Direct investment, FDI, China + Hong Kong received US$106 billion last year [US$70billion from NRC&#8217;s] vs US$3.6 billion [US$0.2b from NRI&#8217;s] for India! Only better Governance can attract FDI and Tourists. In exports, China is nearly +700% of India</strong></p>
<p>Taking the exports of Hong Kong + Macau into account, China’s exports would be +1000% of India! China’s GDP is 50% in manufacturing or $ 650 billion per year. India’s GDP is 25% in manufacturing or $110 billion per year. China’s manufacturing base is nearly 6 times of India’s.</p>
<p><span id="more-2946"></span><br />
<strong>In agriculture our yields per acre, are well below the international norms.</strong></p>
<p>India could be a giant exporter of food, only if we could put our ‘house in order’ to near world class standards! China with lesser cultivable land, produces double the food grains, at 415 million tons per year compared with India’s 208 million tons per year. God has been very kind to India with a lot of sunshine, rain, rivers, lakes, coastline and good hard working citizens.<br />
The governance of hamlets, villages, cities, districts, Government and Semi-Government agencies, as facilitators, have not done enough to show the results that India is able or capable of achieving. India would definitely rate as the No.1 country in the world, for Potential vs Performance!<br />
Indians score high marks on performance, outside India! This is because the Governance is better outside. In countries where the Governance &amp; Administration is poor, the performance of its citizens is also low!</p>
<p><strong>In Education, 99.1% of Chinese children attend school for 9 years, this ensures a high level of literacy. In India, literacy is 50 to 60%</strong></p>
<p>While IIT’s, IIM’s are important, the country’s real growth will come because of primary and secondary education and vocational and educational training in all districts of the country. India can rise and shine in exports, agriculture, literacy and other areas with better governance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently read a news about US government asking Google to provide lots and lots of data related which is related to the services Google provides. I am sure they must be utilizing this data for get to the corrupts. And then automatically me being a typical Indian wanted to check our country’s  rank in that list. To my surprise we rank 3rd in that list after US and Brazil. Wow.. It feels great to be in a such a list. Well that’s one side of the story I was thinking. But after reading the data requests that Google received I started thinking about what would our government departments have actually asked for. Checkout for analysis after the break.</p>
<p><span id="more-2453"></span><br />

<strong>About Google Transparency</strong> : Its an interactive map of Government Requests that shows the number of government inquiries for information about users and requests for Google to take down or censor content. The interactive Traffic graphs provide information about traffic to Google services around the world. Each graph shows historic traffic patterns for a given country/region and service. By illustrating outages, this tool visualizes disruptions in the free flow of information, whether it’s a government blocking information or a cable being cut.</p>
<p>Below is the graph that shows the requests from Indian Government agencies to Google in the past 1 year.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130308104932im_/http://img52.imageshack.us/img52/6910/searchpatterngoogletran.png" alt="" width="600" height="177" /></p>
<p>I’ll leave you guys with that thought because I need to go to bed now. OK, still let me give you some perspective. Have you ever looked at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130308104932/http://www.revolutioners.com/where-the-hell-are-indian-web-developers/">our government websites</a>. I have talked about it earlier as well. But I think the more we are so called developing the more our government is showcase that they are technically sound. I mean I am not talking about the politicians. We bloody pay some great amount of money in taxes can’t we hire some sound technical guys to handle these stuffs. Alright I think I am deviating from the topic.</p>
<p>OK, I was suppose to give you some perspective. Alright, I was just looking at my blog and saw an advertisement on my blog via adsense that I have setup. I did not click on the ad but copied the link to the URL. You believe me it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130308104932/http://www.delhitrafficpolice.nic.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delhi Traffic Police</a> Delhi Traffic Police is advertising via Google Adwords. Anyways, then in curiosity I went to check out the website. Our government needs to accept the fact that their developers su*k.  So there were some nice presentations regarding common wealth games. I could not believe my eyes by looking at the presentation. I mean such a big country and not even one single fucking person in India who can make a good looking presentation. You don’t believe me check <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130308104932/http://www.delhitrafficpolice.nic.in/cwg1.ppt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this out</a>. And yeah I was in an impression since it being a website where the whole world would be browsing to look for updated information but then I saw a link to download flash player which still links to Macromedia site. Thanks to Adobe that they have redirected it to the right place.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I saw it coming. I knew <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130308094546/http://www.revolutioners.com/google-earth-helped-terrorists-but-isro-bhuvan-will-not-what-a-joke/">ISRO Chandrayaan</a> was going to be a failure. I had doubts and ISRO has not left me with any doubts now. Our government has already wasted m0ney on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130308094546/http://www.revolutioners.com/google-earth-helped-terrorists-but-isro-bhuvan-will-not-what-a-joke/">ISRO Bhuvan </a>and now this.</p>
<blockquote><p>ISRO chairman Madhavan Nair has confirmed: “We will have to face the reality but we will have a better opportunity tomorrow.”<br />
<span id="more-1364"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>These guys aren’t over yet. They still wants to waste our money. I am not in favor of these kinds of missions. As stated earlier I want our government to invest in Indian Infrastructure. Build new Railway tracks, build new airports, build better roads; I mean there are millions of things that our government could do. Our government just simply wasted 81 million $ which could have been utilized in a better manner.  It does not matter whether we spent lesser money compared to what others have. All that matters is that we did waste money. And what is bothering me now is that our government is not ready to learn any lesson from this.</p>
<p>“The mission is definitely over. We have lost contact with the spacecraft,” Mayilsamy Annadurai, Project Director of the Chandrayaan-1, told PTI. He said the mission had almost completed its scientific objectives. <strong>“It has done its job technically … 100 per cent. Scientifically also, it has done almost 90-95 per cent of its job,”</strong> said Mr. Annadurai.</p>
<p>What job are we talking about here. What did ISRO Chandrayaan achieve. I am not sure. Can someone throw some light on the achievements of our ISRO Chandrayaan mission apart from some pictures being taken from it.</p>
<p>The mission was built to be failed. Its been proven now.</p>
