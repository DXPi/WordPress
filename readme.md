# Wordpress - TTL

## 2015-08-31

This is a forked repo from the official wordpress repo. It contains a number of changes that we would usually add to a new project. This will help avoid repetition. 

- Wordpress won't auto-update
- Commonly used plugins are added
- Wp-config contains switch statement for multiple environments
- Wp-config contains multisite code as comments
- Removed redundant themes
- Generic .htaccess added
